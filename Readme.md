In this experiment, our method is tested under the [UrbanNav](https://github.com/IPNL-POLYU/UrbanNavDataset) global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) dataset, which was collected from a deep urban canyon of Tokyo. Fig. \ref{fig:GNSS_Traj} shows the car trajectory and GPS measurements whose outliers are caused by tall buildings.

The GNSS provides geographic location information, such as latitude and longitude.

The IMU provides insights into the vehicle's movements through space, including velocity and acceleration.

In addition, we have ground truth from a mature satellite navigation system called Applanix POS LV620 (10Hz). The entire data collection process lasts about 20 minutes, which contains 12410 data samples.

The raw data is collected using Trimble NetR9 GNSS (1Hz) and TAG264 IMU (50Hz), with ground truth from Applanix POS LV620 (10Hz). Total duration: 20 minutes, 12410 samples.
